<div></div><h1><b>Methodology</b></h1><div></div><div>The null hypothesis is female Citi-bike users' average trip duration is the same as male Citib-bike users'. The two distribution is not a normal distribution so T-test or Z-test is not compatible to&nbsp;do the hypothesis testing. Therefore, Mann-Whitney U test is chosen to do the test because Mann-Whitney U test is taking the rank of all data by the total number&nbsp;of sample sizes. However, the Mann-Whitney&nbsp;U test requires that the shape of two sample distribution and standard deviation should be similar. female and male standard deviations are 475.89 and&nbsp; 453.02. The shapes look similar to each other. Mann Whiteny U test is rank a dataset into sumnumber of two sample data size&nbsp;</div><div>MWR = ss.mannwhitneyu(male.tripduration, female.tripduration)</div><div>The builtin function has correction to continuity of function and&nbsp;</div><div></div><div>&nbsp;</div><div></div><div></div><h1 data-label="540554" class="ltx_title_section">Conclusion</h1>
