<div></div><h1><b>Methodology</b></h1><div></div><div>The null hypothesis is the average of female Citi-bike users' trip duration is the same as male Citi-bike users. The two distribution is not a normal distribution so T-test or Z-test is not very compatible to&nbsp;do the hypothesis testing. Therefore, Mann-Whitney U test is chosen to do the test because Mann-Whitney U test can be performed&nbsp;on non-gaussian distributions. The Mann-Whitney U test is taking the rank of all data from 0 to the summation&nbsp;of the total number&nbsp;of sample sizes and comparing between two distribution of median of the ranks.&nbsp;</div><div>Scipy.stats built-in function,&nbsp; scipy.stats.mannwhitneyu(x,y), is used to calculate the p-value.&nbsp;<span>The builtin function has a correction to a continuity of function and the result of p-value is 0.0. Therefore, the median of female and male trip duration doesn't have significant differences.&nbsp;</span></div><div>&nbsp;</div><div></div><div></div><h1 data-label="540554" class="ltx_title_section">Conclusion</h1><div></div><div>Another Class mate comments on the hypothesis test.&nbsp; Zhiao mentioned I&nbsp;should not take out outliners, however, the data set&nbsp;have huge standard deviation and cleaned out over 95 % of data is reasonable&nbsp;to me. Also, he suggests using Z-test however, the two distribution is not normal distribution so Z-test doesn't work.&nbsp;</div>
