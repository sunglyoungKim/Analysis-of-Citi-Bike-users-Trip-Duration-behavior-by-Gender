IDEA:
Women has short trip duration of usage of citibike than men.

NULL HYPOTHESIS:

The women's average trip duration that use of citi-bike is the same as the men's trip duration of usage of the bike.


$H_0$ : $\mu_w  = \mu_m $ 

$H_1$ : $\mu_w  \neq \mu_m $ 

where $\mu_w$ is mean of of Women trip duration, $\mu_m$ is mean of Men trip duration

or identically:

$H_0$ : $\mu_w - \mu_m   = 0 $

$H_1$ : $\mu_w  - \mu_m   \neq 0 $

 I will use a significance level  $\alpha=0.05$

### which means I want the probability of getting a result at least as significant as mine to be less then 5%
