IDEA:
Women has short trip duration of usage of citibike than men.

NULL HYPOTHESIS:

The women's trip duration that use of citi-bike is the same or higher than the men's trip duration of usage of the bike.

\section{$H_0$ : $\frac{F_{Wd}}{W_{n}} >= \frac{F_{Md}}{M_{n}} $ }



\section{$H_1$ : $\frac{F_{Wd}}{W_{n}} < \frac{F_{Md}}{M_{n}} $}

where $F_{Wd}$ is Frequency of Women trip duration, $F_{Md}$ is Frequency of Men trip duration, ${W_{n}}$ is total number of Women, and ${M_{m}}$ is total number of Men

or identically:

$H_0$ : $\frac{F_{Wd}}{W_{n}} - \frac{F_{Md}}{M_{n}} $ >= 0

$H_1$ : $\frac{F_{Wd}}{W_{n}} - \frac{F_{Md}}{M_{n}} $ < 0

\subsection{which means i want the probability of getting a result at least as significant as mine to be less then 5 %}
