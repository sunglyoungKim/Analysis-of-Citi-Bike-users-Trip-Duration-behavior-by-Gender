IDEA:
Women has short trip duration of usage of citibike than men.

NULL HYPOTHESIS:

The women's trip duration that use of citi-bike is the same or higher than the men's trip duration of usage of the bike.

$H_0$_ : $\frac{F_{Wd}}{W_{n}} >= \frac{F_{Md}}{M_{n}} $ 

$H_1$_ : $\frac{F_{Wd}}{W_{n}} < \frac{F_{Md}}{M_{n}} $

where $F_{Wd}$ is Frequency of Women trip duration, $F_{Md}$ is Frequency of Men trip duration, ${W_{n}}$ is total number of Women, and ${M_{m}}$ is total number of Men

or identically:

_$H_0$_ : $\frac{F_{Wd}}{W_{n}} - \frac{F_{Md}}{M_{n}} $ >= 0

_$H_1$_ : $\frac{F_{Wd}}{W_{n}} - \frac{F_{Md}}{M_{n}} $ < 0
# I will use a significance level  $\alpha=0.05$

### which means i want the probability of getting a result at least as significant as mine to be less then 5%
