The citi-bike is a bike sharing system that is run by Motivate in NYC, according to Citi-Bike homepage\cite{nyc}. The system has been operating since May 2013 and it has been operated for 24 hours/day, 7 days/week, 365 days/year because the company installed 600 bike station over 55 neighborhood in NYC \cite{nyc}. Since the sharing system is embeded on NYC the new type of transportation opens new way of one-way trips, such as commute to school, work, or simple running errands. 10 million trips in one year achieved December 2015 and 100,000th annual member gained on May 2016\cite{nyc}.

The Hypothesis is women has short trip duration of usage of citi-bike than men and null hypothesis is the women's average trip duration is the same as the men's trip duration of usage of the bike.

$H_0$ : $\mu_w  = \mu_m $ 

$H_1$ : $\mu_w  \neq \mu_m $ 

where $\mu_w$ is mean of of Women trip duration, $\mu_m$ is mean of Men trip duration

or identically:

$H_0$ : $\mu_w - \mu_m   = 0 $

$H_1$ : $\mu_w  - \mu_m   \neq 0 $

I will use a significance level  $\alpha=0.05$

which means I want the probability of getting a result at least as significant as mine to be less then 5\%
